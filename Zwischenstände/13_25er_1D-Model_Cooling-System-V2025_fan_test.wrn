 *STATUS: ------------------ Start of Case 1 -----------------------------------

  Case Number:        1
  Case Setup Number:  13

*WARN:Detected 5 points which will be deleted from the performance curve.
      There might be different reasons to delete these points:
      1. Positive slope of flow rate vs pressure rise curve
      2. Unrealistic slope of pressure vs flow coefficient curve (Speed Group)
      3. A point on the performance curve which has a flow coefficient which is greater than
         the flow coefficient at the milling point; or has a pressure coefficient which is
         less than the pressure coefficient at the milling point
      4. Point found below the milling curve

*ALERT:FlowPDropTableRef/Pressure_Drop_Cooling_Plate_25_V35
      has static pressure drop entered but it's used at 2 locations
      which have different upstream/downstream areas. This might lead
      to wrong results. Please make a copy of this object and use it 
      at the 2nd location.

*ALERT:A FluidReservoir and/or Tank3D part(s) were detected in a flow circuit 
      using the Implicit flow solver, but the attribute 'Alternate Implicit
      Solver for Faster Convergence of Multi-Fluid Flows' in Advanced Setup ->
      Flow is set to "off". Setting it to 'v2019' can help improve convergence
      and reduce computation time.

*WARN:The circuit "Flow 1 (Column 1)"
      appears to be a closed, fixed-volume system.
      Calculation of the absolute pressure is extremely dependent on
      temperature for a liquid and may not be reliable.
      Convergence difficulties may be encountered.
